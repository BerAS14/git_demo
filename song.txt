We are the champions

second verse
	I've taken my bows
	And my curtain calls
	You've brought me fame and fortune
	And everything that goes with it
	I thank you all
	But it's been no bed of roses no pleasure cruise
	I consider it a challenge before the whole human race
	And I ain't gonna lose
	And I need to go on and on and on and on
