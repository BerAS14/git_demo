We are the champions

first verse
	I've paid my dues
	Time after time
	I've done my sentence
	But committed no crime
	And bad mistakes
	I've made a few
	I've had my share of sand
	Kicked in my face
	But I've come through
	And I need to go on and on and on and on
	
second verse
	I've taken my bows
	And my curtain calls
	You've brought me fame and fortune
	And everything that goes with it
	I thank you all
	
chorus
	We are the champions - my friend
	And we'll keep on fighting till the end
	We are the champions
	We are the champions
	No time for losers
	Cause we are the champions of the world
